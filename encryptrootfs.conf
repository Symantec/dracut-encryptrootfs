# Where to get the RSA and/or ECDSA keys for dropbear, options are:
#  GENERATE: generate a new one for each initrd run, the public key will be printed during the dracut build process
#            and on boot
#  SYSTEM:   use (convert) the host key from the host system's SSH daemon. This will make the initrd ssh indistinguishable
#            from the running system - this may be a security risk, depending on your threat model, but simplifies
#            your client-side ssh configuration
#  /path/to/openssh_key:   an absolute path to a host key, in openssh format. A public key with '.pub' ending should be present too
#
# It is recommend that you use the system one, or supply your own.  If using the system key, be aware that an attacker
# that can access your initrd could use the host key to impersonate the running system.  This could allow them to attempt
# an MITM attack.
